Currency Converter – Detailed Overview
✅ What is a Currency Converter?
A Currency Converter is a web application that allows users to convert an amount from one currency into another. It uses real-time exchange rates fetched from an external API to ensure accurate and up-to-date conversions.

🌐 How It Works:
User enters an amount (e.g., 100).

Selects the base currency (e.g., USD).

Selects the target currency (e.g., EUR).

On clicking the Convert button:

JavaScript fetches current exchange rates from an API like ExchangeRate API.

The input amount is multiplied by the correct rate.
